Uses: We build this application to help people in danger. User can connect to nearest hospital, police station
and fire station. Just by pressing the panic button, users current location can be send to Family
members at regular interval SMS and automatically dial 911.

For the first milestone we worked on: 
1)the first page is the login page. Login doesn't work at this point.
2) You can click on skip to navigate to main page
3)All the main activity has there own personal page
=>police;hospital;firestation has still google map api to configure and Member has login information for maximum 3 members
4) We are currently looking into google map API integration.
5)Working with user login page.
