Uses: We build this application to help people in danger. User can connect to nearest hospital, police station
and fire station. Just by pressing the panic button, users current location can be send to Family
members at regular interval SMS and automatically dial 911.

For the first milestone we worked on: 
1)We choose to work on navigation for activity.This formates look more clean.
2)We used fragments for hospitals, police station and firestation. 
3) We are currently looking into google map API integration.
4)Working with user login page.
